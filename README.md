# Vagrant Install ðŸ’»

I was think a lot about how to automate things and I'm developing some scripts to do it.

I created this script to download the vagrant and install automatically!

The user just needs to start the sh file. 

If any error occurs, the installation will stop and a message error will show in your terminal.
